The digital kiosks are placed at strategic locations, such as entrances and checkout areas, enabling customers to sanitize their hands conveniently before entering or after handling goods. This trend has gained momentum, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has heightened awareness around cleanliness. Retailers benefit from the kiosks by enhancing their safety measures, boosting customer confidence, and ensuring compliance with public health guidelines. As the retail landscape becomes more competitive, providing a hygienic and safe environment has become a key factor in attracting and retaining customers.The banking sector is another crucial segment for the adoption of digital hand sanitizer kiosks in the Asia–Pacific market. Banks, being high-traffic facilities that handle a large volume of transactions daily, are adopting these kiosks to safeguard both their employees and customers.
