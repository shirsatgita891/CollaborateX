Additionally, the rise of direct-to-consumer sales strategies and influencer marketing has further accelerated the growth of this segment.</p><p>The growth of the online sales segment can also be attributed to the increasing penetration of smartphones and internet connectivity in the Asia–Pacific region. As more consumers become comfortable with online shopping, especially in countries like China, South Korea, and Japan, the demand for Fullerene masks through online channels is expected to continue expanding. Furthermore, the convenience of home delivery, coupled with attractive online discounts, has contributed to the rapid adoption of these products in the region.</p><h2>Offline Sales Segment</h2><p>Offline sales of Fullerene masks in the Asia–Pacific region continue to maintain a strong presence, particularly in countries where brick-and-mortar retail has a deep-rooted history.
